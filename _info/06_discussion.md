[Here is the CS 111 Piazza discussion group](https://piazza.com/ucsb/winter2020/cs111).
All students are expected 
to join this group and watch it for course announcements. 
You should also use it to post any questions about the course.
Also, students should answer and discuss other people's questions 
(without giving away the solutions to homework problems).
