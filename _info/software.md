# Software

We will be using [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/) (version 3.5 or higher) for programming in this course,
leaning heavily on the following three packages:

* [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/): Numerical computing with arrays and matrices
* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/): More advanced numerical computing, including sparse matrices
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html): Plotting and visualization

We will use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run Python interactively, in a web browser, both for demos 
in class and for your programming assignments. I strongly recommend that you set up your own laptop or computer to
run Jupyter and Python 3 (and numpy, scipy, and matplotlib). 
The easy way to do this is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), which
will install everything you need. The t.a.s will demo the setup process in the first section, on Tuesday,
January 8.

It's also possible to run Python in a Jupyter notebook in a web browser at CSIL. You can go that route if it
works better for you, but it's much easier to run everything on your own computer. (That's what I do.)

Previous versions of this course used [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), which is a proprietary
interactive numerical software package that's widely used in engineering. (UCSB has a
[campuswide MATLAB license](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/university-california-santa-barbara-40469638.html).)
Numpy is designed to look a lot like Matlab.
They both use arrays and matrices as their main data structures;
the advantage of numpy is that you also have all of Python available.
If you already know Matlab, here is a
[cheat sheet for translating Matlab into numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).
The matplotlib library that we will use for plotting also has a lot of similarity to Matlab's plotting routines.
