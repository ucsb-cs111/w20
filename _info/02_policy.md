# Homework policy

There will be a homework assignment every week. You may talk to each
other about the assignment, but what you submit must be your own work. 

<b>Turnin Rules:</b>
Homework is due on Mondays no later than 11:59 pm. 
You must turn in your homework online, in GradeScope, 
as a single PDF file.
When you turn in your PDF, you must tell GradeScope which pages
of your document contain each individual homework problem.

<span style="color:red">No late homework will be accepted
under any circumstances</span>, 
but I will drop your two lowest homework grades.

Requests for regrades may be submitted through GradeScope.
<span style="color:red">The statute of
limitations for regrades is one week<span>&mdash;that is, any requests
for regrades must be made no later than one week after the homework
grades were made available in GradeScope. 
The last homeworks in the course will have an earlier deadline for
regrade requests, which will be announced on Piazza.
</span>

When a homework problem requires writing some Python code, 
you should turn in all of the following. 
We'll give you detailed instructions for turning in your .py code 
through the GradeScope autograder when that's required.
Watch the Piazza page for details for each particular homework assignment.

1. A description in English of what you did and how. Try to be brief
but clear. If we can't understand what you did, you will lose points;
we won't regrade homework that was not explained well.
2. The Python code you wrote, through the GradeScope autograder.
3. Your output from testing and running your Python code.
4. Any figures or plots you produced.

You will write up your homework using LaTeX, 
which is the standard markup language for mathematical documents
and is good to know for any future math or CS writing you may do.
To get you started, 
[here is the LaTeX](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.tex) for the 
[review quiz](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.pdf).

# Exam policy

There will be two midterms in class and a final exam during finals week.
Syllabi and sample problems will be made available for each midterm,
by the weekend before the midterm.
The final exam will be cumulative, covering all the topics in the course.

For the exams you may bring one page of your own paper notes,
which you must turn in with your exam.
No other references or books are allowed.
You may not use phones, pads, or electronic devices of any kind.

We will grade the exams in GradeScope, 
and requests for regrades must be submitted through GradeScope.
The deadlines for submitting regrade requests will be posted here before the exams.
