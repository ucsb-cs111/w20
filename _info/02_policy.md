# Homework policy

There will be a homework assignment every week. You may talk to each
other about the assignment, but what you submit must be your own work. 

<b>New Turnin Rules:</b>
Homework is due on Fridays no later than 6:00 pm. 
You must turn in your homework online, in GradeScope, as a
single PDF file.
When you turn in your PDF, you must tell GradeScope which pages
of your document contain each individual homework problem.
Doing this correctly will be worth 2 points on the homework.

<span style="color:red">No late homework will be accepted
under any circumstances</span>, but I will drop your two lowest
homework grades.

Requests for regrades may be submitted through GradeScope.
<span style="color:red">The statute of
limitations for regrades is one week<span>&mdash;that is, any requests
for regrades must be made no later than one week after the homework
or exam grades were made available in GradeScope.

When a homework problem requires writing some Python code, 
you should turn in all of the following. We may ask you to
you to turn in your actual .ipynb Jupyter notebook file through
the CSIL "turnin" command in addition to using GradeScope; watch
the Piazza page for details for each particular homework assignment.
(As of hw02, you don't have to do this yet.)

1. A description in English of what you did and how. Try to be brief
but clear. If we can't understand what you did, you will lose points;
we won't regrade homework that was not explained well.
2. The Python code you wrote.
3. The output from testing and running your Python code.
4. Any figures or plots you produced.

I strongly encourage you to write up your homework using LaTeX, 
which is the standard markup language for mathematical documents
and is good to know for any future math or CS writing you may do.
To get you started, [here is the LaTeX](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.tex) for the [review quiz](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.pdf).
