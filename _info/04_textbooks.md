# Textbooks

I will assign readings from various sources online during the quarter.
Some readings (and homework problems) will be from the book
[Numerical Computing with Matlab](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/textbooks/ncm/), 
by Cleve Moler.
This textbook uses MATLAB rather than Python, 
but it's still a good reference for several of the topics we will study.
The book has a [web site](http://www.mathworks.com/moler/index_ncm.html),
from which you can download individual chapters.
If you want to buy a hard copy, you can
order it from [SIAM](http://ec-securehost.com/SIAM/ot87.html), 
the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
As a UCSB student you can become a
[member of SIAM](http://www.siam.org/membership/individual/free.php)
for free (talk to me if you want to join).

# Reading assignments

Reading assignments are given with each lecture, in the lecture files.

# Videos and other things

Professor Gil Strang of MIT has videotaped his terrific
[lectures on linear algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/).
I recommend watching the first few lectures, which are a great way to
review the background for the first half of CS 111.
