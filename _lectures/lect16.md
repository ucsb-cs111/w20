# Reading assignment

Review for the final next Wednesday!

# References for today's lecture

NCM sections 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3.

# Outline

- Continuing our tour of three PDEs ...

- The diffusion equation (time-varying temperature problem)
  - Constant coefficients: The heated bar
  - Variable coefficients: The insulated bar
  - A Neumann boundary condition
  - Animations of matplotlib plots
- The wave equation (second-order derivatives in time)
- An example of the wave equation in practice (from SCEC and SDSC)
