Sections 2.1 through 2.6 (linear equations and Gaussian elimination).


# Outline

Understanding Ax = b in the temperature problem.

Matrix and vector arithmetic in numpy.

Some interesting kinds of matrices: 
   - identity matrix
   - singular and nonsingular
   - permutation matrices (and permutation vectors)

   - triangular matrices
   - Gaussian elimination
   - LU factorization
   - Partial pivoting
