# Rules

Phones off!

Closed book exam.
You may bring one sheet of paper with notes on both sides, 
and you must turn that sheet in with your exam.
No electronic devices of any kind. 
You won't need to do any complicated numerical calculations,
and if we ask you for Python code we won't mark it off for
exact syntax or details of argument lists.

Use a dark pen (preferred) or dark soft pencil, 
and write your answers legibly within the
boxes provided.
