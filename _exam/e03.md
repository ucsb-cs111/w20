The final exam will be in our regular classroom {% include exam_on_from_to %}.

# Rules

Phones off!
You may use any books, notes, or written materials, 
but no electronic devices of any kind. 
You won't need to do any complicated numerical calculations.

Use a dark pen (preferred) or soft, dark pencil, 
and write your answers legibly within the boxes provided.
If your handwriting is too faint for the scanner to pick up,
it's likely that you will not get credit for your answer.


# Syllabus

The final exam covers everything we've done in the course.
The format and content of the final will be very similar to that of
the midterms. 
The final will be longer than a midterm, 
but I don't expect it to take the full 3 hours.

You can review the sample problems from the first and second midterms
(and also the problems from the midterms themselves).

As usual, we won't ask you to do any coding on the exam (more than one line), but the exam may ask questions related to any of the homework problems.
