The midterm exam will be in class {% include exam_on_from_to %}.

# Rules

Phones off!
You may use notes or written materials, 
but no electronic devices of any kind. 
You won't need to do any complicated numerical calculations,
and if we ask you for Python code we won't mark it off for
exact syntax or details of argument lists.

Use a dark pen (preferred) or soft pencil, 
and write your answers legibly within the
boxes provided.

# Sample problems

- Here are [some sample problems](https://github.com/ucsb-cs111/w19-lecture-files/blob/master/02.27/sampleprobs02.pdf).

- Steven will answer questions about the sample problems in section on Tuesday before the exam, but you will have to work them yourself before section in order to be prepared!

- We won't ask you to do any coding on the exam (more than one line), but the exam may ask questions related to any of the homework problems.
